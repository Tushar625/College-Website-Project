                    The three-year undergraduate programme comes with elective options of Mathematics,
                    Electronics, Computer Science, Chemistry (any two). Topics covered in the curriculum
                    include Electrostatics, Wave and Optics, Quantum and Classical Mechanics, Nuclear and
                    Particle Physics and more. With the right combination of electives, this course will
                    not only allow you to explore your interests and discover your strengths but amplify
                    your readiness for a range of careers. Academics, research and development jobs in
                    private and public sectors including space, defence and aeronautical research and
                    atomic energy are all possible future paths.
