                    Did you listen with rapt attention as your high-school History teacher explained
                    the ramifications of World War II? Do the mysteries of the past inspire you to
                    understand them and, in so doing, change the present? Then this is the undergraduate
                    programme for you. Our three-year Honours course covers a wide range of topics in
                    Indian and World History — ancient, medieval and modern — and equips you for a career
                    not just in academics, but also museum sciences, archaeology, government service,
                    journalism, publishing, international humanitarian agencies and more.
