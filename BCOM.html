                    PIE's undergraduate degree in commerce is one of our most rigorous courses.
                    The degree is designed to provide students with a wide range of managerial
                    skills, while at the same time building competence in particular areas of
                    business. Towards that aim, in addition to their major, students of the
                    programme are exposed to general business principles with courses in
                    accounting, finance, business management, human resources, (business)
                    statistics, marketing and economics.

                <p class = "course-info">
                    <em>PSO1:</em> The students are provided with a holistic view of the subjects
                    to be covered in the curriculum so that they may develop
                    knowledge about the domain of their studies.                    
                </p>

                <p class = "course-info">
                    <em>PSO2:</em> Students are encouraged to apply their minds as opposed to
                    learning by rote, thereby embracing the art of critical
                    thinking. Their vision is sought to be enlarged so as to allow
                    them to think laterally, think independently, think out of the
                    box.
                    
                </p>

                <p class = "course-info">
                    <em>PSO3:</em> The interest in the subject is sought to be sparked in the
                    student's mind so that they may be encouraged to selfmotivate themselves in the pursuit of knowledge.
                </p>

                <p class = "course-info">
                    <em>PSO4:</em> Students are sought to be kept abreast with the latest
                    developments in the fields of studies that are relevant to them.
                    This not only helps them in their employability quotients, but
                    also ensures a greater, in-depth understanding of the subject
                    being pursued.
                </p>

                <p class = "course-info">
                    <em>PSO5:</em> Adequate amount of stress is also accorded in ensuring that
                    the students develop the necessary social and interpersonal
                    skills. Special attention is provided in the area of corporate
                    and commercial skills.
