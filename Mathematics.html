                    Mathematics is a crucial area of study whether in academia or the
                    professional sector such as engineering. Our honours course in
                    Mathematics gives you a strong foundation in the fundamentals
                    of the subject and covers a wide range of topics including Classical,
                    Modern, Linear and Vector Algebra, Vector and Tensor Calculus, Linear
                    Programming and Game Theory, Analytical Statics and Dynamics, Hydrostatics
                    and Rigid Dynamics, Probability, Statistics and more. The course equips you
                    with analytic, problem-solving and logical-thinking skills and gives you a
                    head start for careers in diverse fields from finance and business to
                    healthcare and technology.
